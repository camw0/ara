# Ara

A music bot written with ErelaJS and DiscordJS (v14).

Support for Spotify and YouTube playback straight outta the box.

### Installation

Install the node_modules necessary with Yarn (or NPM).
```
# If you're using npm:
npm i

#If you're using yarn:
yarn install

Then, create a config.json file, copy the contents of `config.json.example` into it and customize the bot to your liking.

After that, you can start the bot by running:
```
node src/index.js
```
